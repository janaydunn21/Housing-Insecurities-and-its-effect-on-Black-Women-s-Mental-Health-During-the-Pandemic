As a recent Psychology graduate, I was introduced to the field of Bioinformatics at my university, and that experience led me to this exciting opportunity at NSS. 

My interest in this project was sparked by the 2022 news broadcast, which drew attention to the high number of evictions among African American women in Missouri before and during the pandemic. As a black woman, I did not experience this firsthand during the pandemic as I worked from home in tech support and shopped online. This prompted me to wonder about the mental health of women in Missouri both before and during COVID-19. 


The aim of this project is to increase awareness and provide insights into the patterns and trends of Anxiety and Depression and Unemployment for women experiencing mental health symptoms in the United States during the pandemic. Additionally, I will be providing recommendations for addressing mental health during a lockdown.


Data Question
1.	What is the overall trend in reported symptoms of anxiety and depression during the pandemic?

2.	How does the reported frequency of symptoms of anxiety and depression among women compare to other demographic groups during the pandemic?

3. What is the trend in initial unemployment claims in Missouri on a weekly basis?

4. Which industries have the highest number of monthly unemployment claims in Missouri?

5. What is the racial distribution of unemployment claims in Missouri, and how does it compare to the overall population demographics?


My targeted audience for this project will be for all but specifically targeted to black women for education and awareness. 

Known Issues and Challenges
•	Underreporting: For example, black women historical trauma of data- some black  women may feel reluctant to report systems for fear of judgement or discrimination. 
•	Possible bias in the data. For example, black  women may not have the access to mental health services. 
•	Intersectionality: Some black  women experience mental health symptoms differently than other culture groups. 
•	Sample size



What's Next?
• Create a mental health and housing (during pandemic) survey for black  women in Missouri.
• Symposium for students using the found data. 
• Reach out to former professors for assistance. 
• Find other data to support why black women were being evicted

The goal of this project is to bring awareness and to educate those who identify as black women that experienced symptoms of mental illness in the United States, during COVID. What motivated me about this topic was a 2022 news broadcasting shedding light on the disproportionate number of evictions in Black/African American women in my current state of Missouri before and during the pandemic. This was not my experience during COVID as a black woman. I worked from home in Tech Support.

Through my analysis, I will identify patterns and trends, and develop recommendations for addressing mental health needs during ‘lock down’.

Data Question
1.	Are there any mental illness symptoms that are most experienced during the pandemic, and how do these symptoms vary pre and during COVID in black women?

2.	Are there disparities in mental health outcomes between black women and other demographic groups during this pandemic, and if so, did healthcare access contribute to these disparities?

3.	What factors contributed to the significant increase in unemployment rates among black women during the pandemic?

4. 

My targeted audience for this project will be for all but specifically targeted to black women for education and awareness. 

Known Issues and Challenges
•	Underreporting: For example, historical trauma and lack of data- some black women may feel reluctant to report systems for fear of judgement or discrimination. 
•	Possible bias in the data. For example, black women may not have the access to mental health services. 
•	Intersectionality: Some black women experience mental health symptoms differently than other culture groups. 
•	Sample size



What's Next?
• Create a mental health and housing (during pandemic) survey for black women in Missouri.
• Symposium for students using the found data. 
• Reach out to former professors for assistance.
